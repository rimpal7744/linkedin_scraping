Our company has been dominating in the outsourcing market for 20+ years, empowering global organizations to improve their efficiency and save costs by taking over their non-core business functions, from data services and administrative support to research, e-commerce operation, and process automation.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝘁 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗱

As a first-generation entrepreneur and visionary, I acquired my in-depth domain expertise championing key leadership roles for automotive giants like Toyota Motor Corporation, Daewoo Motors, and Royal Enfield. I had also acquired SAP consultancy skills through a stint with an IT firm early in my career.

This laid a foundation for creating and building up TransForm Solutions, a leading provider of back-office support, administration and automation services.

We started with humble beginnings, yet our entrepreneurial spirit and determined mindset propelled our growth - one step, one customer, and one team member at a time - eventually turning us into a full-fledged organization catering to versatile businesses.

𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀 & 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁

Now, we are the ""growth partners"" for multiple global organizations and businesses, delivering solutions that help them gain an edge over the competition.

We've helped over 690+ companies focus their time and efforts on core business offerings by managing their support operations, also achieving 75% productivity growth and 50% efficiency increase for our clients.

Our specialties include: Back Office Operations, Dedicated Remote Teams, Virtual Captive Centers, Data Services, eCommerce Support Operations, B2B Research Services, and Robotic Process automation (RPA).

𝗠𝘆 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀

As a winner of the Outsourcing Leadership Award, I was recognized among 30 Most Talented Outsourcing Industry Leaders. I also received The International Gold Star Millennium Award (from the former Prime Minister of Thailand) for contribution into economic cooperation across Asia.

I invest in growing startups as well as support Non-Profit Associations. My business mentoring work is dedicated to fostering the Next Generation of Entrepreneurs and SMBs. I’m also the Country Head at Clearsky Cloud, a next generation cloud and active cyber-risk management platform.

Along with 2 college hostel mates who I met at IIT Delhi, I decided to start Attentive.ai in 2017.

Initially, we ran it as an AI services company where we built the most accurate geospatial AI in the world. In 2020, we stumbled upon the outdoor field services industry, including landscaping maintenance, snow removal, paving maintenance, construction, and facilities maintenance where people had been living in the Flintstones era when it came to software and technology.

As we dug deeper, we realized that the industry had a massive property measurement problem that landscapers and pavers faced on a daily basis. It was clear that without geospatial AI, all software solutions in the industry were broken. This was our Eureka moment and in 2021, we embarked on our vertical SaaS journey with the launch of our first product - Automeasure.

With a focus on saving time and reducing wasteful activities, we have developed AI-based automation solutions for commercial landscape maintenance, snow removal, paving maintenance, and construction businesses.

Through our cutting-edge technology, we help outdoor service companies automate aerial and blueprint takeoffs, boost sales productivity, optimize sales processes, and win more jobs without additional manual efforts.

Our solutions have earned the trust of over 280 outdoor services businesses in the US and Canada, including industry giants like United Land Services, Juniper Landscaping, Cleanscapes, Maldonado Landscaping, and many more.

------------------Prius Intelli (https://www.priusintelli.com/) is a vertically integrated geospatial services company.

We make conventionally expensive data and services affordable and bite-sized. We sell high-resolution, high-accuracy aerial imagery and elevation data. Our imagery is offered in 2.5-15 cm resolution (depended on client need or requests), and has a horizontal accuracy range from less than 6” up to just over 12”, dependent on the resolution. We collect our imagery on an order-by-order basis, so what we normally do is receive an outline (shapefile or .kmz) of the particular AOI, then schedule the flight and collect the imagery. Our normal turnaround time from the order being placed to the imagery being delivered within a few weeks, weather dependent. We deliver the imagery in several different ways, from XYZ/WMS/WMTS links to the .tiffs themselves.

We also leverage the imagery to develop quality derivative elevation products, such as digitized vector data, elevation models, contour lines, stream networks, etc. alongside the imagery itself.

We have seen our imagery and elevation data be and used in the processes of route planning, pipeline classification, PHMSA compliance, right-of-way work, and overall system monitoring.

Thanks for showing interest. Here are some highlights to know me better.

Year 2020:

You will currently find me focused on stabilizing SmartKarrot and its initial customer base. The added responsibility of practicing what we preach is challenging but very fruitful. Along with the responsibilities of being the Founder-CEO, I play the role of being the Chief Success Partner to both our employees as well as our valued customers. This is an interesting phase in the industry, and we sense and see a convergence happening in how organizations evolve to handle customer success, customer experience and product success in the digital economy. My vision for SmartKarrot is to make it the easiest-to-use, predictable and prescriptive-when-required platform which customer’s love using every day!

Year 2019:

A 10 year + journey comes to an end as I exit emids. Very proud of my contributions in creating a $250M+ valued business. Extraordinary learnings in this journey as I successfully created and grew their biggest and most profitable health technology business unit from scratch. I learned the value of providing genuine and consistent value to both customers and employees here and thus began the idea which evolved into SmartKarrot.

Year 2008:

Mortgage meltdown! And guess where I was – in the mortgage servicing industry handling a technology product suite for loan servicing. We actually did well as the volume of foreclosures went up. My biggest learning was how to keep your customers close and I did have the privilege of creating a global account management and pre-sales team from scratch. Guess I was always meant to be in the customer success business :-)!

Year 2005:

It takes bravery, courage, and resilience to succeed in just about anything worth doing, in particular, starting and growing businesses. Having been a part of multiple high-performing and successful ventures, all the hard work is certainly worth it, when you're doing it with great people. I place a very high value on learning and curiosity, leadership, teamwork, and treating people well. Over my 15-year career, I've managed to travel, live, and work in 20 different countries across Latin America, Europe, Asia, and North America. This experience has taught me the true value of culture and diversity and has made me who I am today. My superpower is knowing what I don't know and finding someone or some way to learn from in those moments. I'm a loving husband and father of a beautiful little boy. When I'm not with them or Optic Power, you can find me running, reading my kindle, listening to the Knowledge Project by Shane Parish, watching the LA Rams and STL Cards, or getting out to the rainforest in Puerto Rico.

------------------I was promoted to CEO during our growth phase and tasked with hiring an executive leadership team across engineering, marketing, and finance to support our scale. I currently manage the global P&L of the business and set organizational direction and priorities. During this time, I've shaped our long-term vision, mission, and values and restructured the organization across 3 service brands, 15 countries, and 350 employees. We have developed a people-first culture with an emphasis on strong managers, consistent feedback, team-collaboration, and continuous improvement. Optic Power has grown over 700% in employees and revenue in just a 3 year period. During this time, I've scaled up our marketing organization to drive our repeatable unit economic model for future growth. We've instilled strong engineering practices based on communities and asynchronous communication. We've topped every one of Lattice's benchmarks for adoption of feedback, manager 1:1's, career tracks, and OKR's. And we're still innovating with how we use people analytics to inform organizational improvement. While we have a long way to go and much to improve, we're building an organization to last and that everyone, no matter who you are or where you're from, can be a part of.

------------------After my departure from TeleSign, I repeatedly had requests from my network to replicate the global BD model we built there. With a long-time friend and colleague, we build a boutique consulting and services company, OneRep.io. We initially supported early-stage technology startups in the seed to series B stages and then expanded to support project deployments for US-based organizations expanding into EMEA and APAC. We grew the business to a $4m annual run rate business, helping scale 2 separate organizations to a $1b valuation. OneRep.io eventually merged with Optic Power and rebranded as Sales Clover. Our service is still growing and supporting some of the leading brands in Cybersecurity, HRtech, Proptech, and more. Sales Clover has over 100 employees in 2 countries.

------------------Post-Merger, I was tasked with designing and executing our Optic Power growth plan, which included building our sales, marketing, and business development teams. My organization drove 700% growth of top-line during a 3-year window. I partnered with our engineering organization to develop a niche-market focus in the gaming and esports industry, which was the leading category for the organization during the last 2 years. We secured deals with 3 of the 5 largest professional eSports teams, including Team Liquid, TeamSolo Mid, and 100 Thieves. During my time in this role, we scaled the business side of the organization from 2 people to over 100 in just 2 short years.

------------------Led the build of Usermind's first EMEA operation from 0, which included operations, finance, and legal setup. Managed strategic EMEA customer relationships in partnership with Mckinsey and Bain, including Suez Waste Management, Atlas Copco, All Saints, and Volvo. Usermind was an Andreesen Horowitz-funded startup, so I attended and supported A16z portfolio briefings on Usermind's technology. Was fortunate enough to partner with senior leaders at the forefront of digital transformation and end-to-end customer experience design. The office I built in Serbia existed as a sales, business development, and engineering office until Usermind's eventual acquisition by Qualtrics.

------------------I describe myself as a disruptive technology innovator. I started my career as an engineer in process automation and advanced controls, and then moved to the realtime AI business in 1991 when no was aware that such technology could exist, except for those who researched it in the most advanced laboratories such as MIT. I was lucky and honoured to have worked with the first pioneers in AI for the past 30 years. I have experienced probably every possible application you could deploy in the process industry from preventing abnormal situations and equipment failures, to production and energy optimization, and scenarios that worked and failed. As an ardent creative, innovative and visionary, I had to create my own start-up, Integration Objects, and build my dream product “KnowledgNet”. KnowledgeNet is an advanced application deployment platform that allows you to quickly deploy knowledge based solutions leveraging AI technologies such as inferencing and fault propagation engines, and machine learning among many other things. It captures operational and first principle knowledge and empowers end-users to run their operations efficiently, and maximize the uptime of their assets. I am now working on our next generation technology breakthrough which is in the area of enterprise integration in-line with our vision of what is needed for industry 5.0. KnowledgeNet was sold to the top indstrial companies in the world, and then the related IP and business was sold to Emerson in 2019.
I am now in the process of releasing my other dream product, SIoTH (Smart IoT Highway) which is an out of the box smart integration platform that runs in the DMZ, a multi protocol translators with all standard cyber security and AI features, providing a single unified HMI to the entire operation through a Web based visualization tool.
My most important strength is transform young and inexperienced engineers, into talented leaders quickly with passion and thrust for growing their knowledge in a sustainable manner.
I possess strong records of creating successful start-ups globally, transforming a vision into reality. I have merger and acquisition experience dealing with all levels of details including building accurate business and financial forecasts, company valuation, legal, IP and operations due diligence.

At SkillGigs we believe in challenging the status quo on how to hire top-notch talent. We believe that talent is king when it comes to a company’s success. We challenge the status quo by using awesome user friendly AI and Big Data based technology to acquire, evaluate and hire top-notch talent. By challenging the status quo we have been able to bring companies access to talent they don't have on their own, and also help them hire with far more confidence than every before in the shortest time possible.

We also believe that a lot of great talent with potential is leaving behind a lot of opportunity on the table and not leveraging the demand for their skills to their fullest potential in enhancing their careers. We are challenging the status quo for how talent is used to finding jobs or growing their careers by using AI and Big Data technology- helping them realize their true and full potential. We call this the ""The Art of Finding The Perfect Job"". We believe that we are not just a platform for top talent but also their greatest advocates.

The company helps IT resellers find qualified consultants to augment their existing capabilities and help them compete in some of the largest and most complex mega-deal IT projects.

It helps consultants and integrators to find more projects quicker, get paid faster, more consistently, and get work VISAs (if needed). Plus, it helps vendors to extend the capabilities of their existing reseller base—so their resellers can better integrate their product as part of some of the largest, most complex bids. In addition, IQ Tech Pros provides professional packaged IT services direct to customers that are not already working with a partner.

IQ Tech Pros uses a NEW model, not one of the old “BIG consultant” models, it is like a consulting co-op where the members are treated as partners and everyone does much better—the consultants, the resellers and the organization needing help.

I read ~15 (Non-Fiction) books a month. I am joyful cuz I don't waste time chit-chatting and doing mind-numbing stuff.

Two events taught me about Life and Death. I lost my daughter Disha to the rarest form of cancer (Rhabdomyosarcoma) in 2017, a month before turning 17. In March 2019, another blow happened when I lost my beautiful wife, creative partner, and founding member of Pepper Square.

Risk-taking is my real deal. There is so much one can do to change the way we live. Time is my only asset. Do not waste it.

P.S. I am working on a product that will make everyone a High-Performer. I am looking for a super duper young tech Co-Founder and a team of Software Engineers to be part of my new venture. If you are game DM me.

------------------Namaste

My 16 and half year old daughter taught me that nothing is permanent. I lost her on 18th August 2017, just one month before her 17th birthday.

Losing her to the deadliest disease ""Cancer"" has taught me that I must share the importance of Food, Body, and Health.

I meet 100s of people every month from different walks of life and share my learnings and insights on how we are fed with POISON in our lives.

Want to LIVE a healthy life? Follow me @MukiRegunathan on Instagram.

------------------I started companies like mfusion, Spinnova, iCity, Metaglyphix, Kidsgalaxy and Safron ROCK. Worked on interesting ideas like Time4peace, ContactGOD but couldn't scale.

I have worked with few companies as a full and part time employee. They are Fresh Force, ICE94, Deccan Yellow Pages, Cyber Design, Sintex, Q-Soft, SwissSoft, Karnataka Financial Services, India Nexus.

I have no REGRETS in life. All my learning are from observing and experimenting in life and these experiences taught me how NOT to fuel my passion alone but to translate ideas to create self sustainable & profitable business.

------------------I had a great opportunity working with finest business folks at Rapidigm and creative folks at Rapidigm Interactive. Talk to me about the life before and after the DOT com burst, i can fill Youtube.

America is my second home, i love the diversity, big dreams, science, processes and people. It is the most modern civilization in the world.

I was based out of Portland but travelled extensively across America. I have many interesting stories while working at Rapidigm. One of them attending an Interview at Xerox at 5:30am on a cold winter day and got fired at 5:45am cuz of the dot com burst. *smiles*

------------------One of the best companies i have worked in my entire career. I had the opportunity to work under S.Ramakrishnan, i call him SR. He taught me how to run a business and manage people for the business of LIFE.

I would proudly say that we were one of the first companies in India to work on a kick ass product idea for PARC. It was called Content Guard.

The company was called Icon Infotech and renamed as Savantech, the branding was conceptualized by me in my loo. I worked with Prasad Ram (Who was the ex-CTO of Google India).

I haven't seen SR for a long time now. I tried connecting with him in Chennai, but failed. If anyone has his contacts give me a buzz and i will take you out for a great lunch.

My expertise is advising companies in the enterprise software and security, and I have worked with many leading tech companies including Microsoft, Oracle, Alibaba, Sandvine, Concur, Epicor, and Tumbleweed Communications.

At Pathlock, we’re helping the world’s largest enterprises and organizations automate the enforcement of controls of access, process, or cybersecurity checks, for any business application organizations like Microsoft, Corning, Honeywell, Office Depot, Geico, and numerous state governments and universities choose to work with us because they are seeking some combination of the following:


- Automate GRC audit processes by continuous control monitoring
- Apply access control-based user privilege specific to a transaction and user location
- Enhance governance, risk, and compliance strategies by providing granular access logs
- Vulnerability management and threat detection tools.

Please visit pathlock.com to learn more.

------------------Protect ERP data at a Field / Transaction-Level and take control of your ERP application
- Contextual Security
- User behavior visibility in the ERP application

Over 90% of enterprise application breaches involve the use of valid credentials (insider threat). Appsian offers application security that is natively integrated (not a customization) into ERP applications such as SAP, Peoplesoft or Oracle EBS, to add transaction and user level security capabilities that traditional ERP systems lack:

- To enable companies to broaden the reach of their ERP system beyond their secure networks by providing the necessary controls to allow users to safely and securely access their ERP systems.
- To help companies keep sensitive ERP user data safe from costly breaches.
- To provide swift incident response and audit management for internal or external breaches.

------------------Taking our learnings from Microsoft and Brocade, Henry Fong and I co-founded RTM Asia and helped hundreds of startups grow their Asia business and become multi-billion-dollar companies.

EqualLogic was building storage systems to power the technology service economy before it was known as the cloud. In two years’ time, RTM Asia built, ran, and grew EqualLogic’s Asia-Pacific business from 1M per year to 20M. In 2008, the company was acquired by Dell for $1.4B.

NetSuite was the first company to make cloud ERP accessible. RTM Asia identified the trend early on and helped NetSuite grow their revenue and raise $40M from Japan-based strategic investors. NetSuite was later acquired by Oracle for $9.3B.

Concur was one of the first companies creating back-end systems for big enterprise companies. RTM Asia helped the company grow their business in Asia and increase revenue by nothing to 15M annually. Concur was later acquired by SAP for $8.3B.

While I've led teams of over 1,000, I'm at my best when devising and executing new growth strategies through smaller groups of executive-level personnel.

I have a blend of experiences in strategic, financial and operational management. I also have an in-depth knowledge of the insurance market. As a result, I've pioneered numerous new brand enhancing products and solutions for the insurance, automotive, warranty, banking and retail industries.

Having relocated to the US from South Africa several years ago, I'm continually excited by the untapped business opportunities I see here in the US.

Specialties: Outsourced Services. Insurance process, re-insurance, outsourcing, procurement and finance. A particular strength is using this knowledge to improve margins and returns, enable brand extension and develop specialist insurance products for a wide range of businesses across diverse industries.

On a broader scale, my skills in strategic planning, new product development, global business development and financial management are applicable across most industries.

------------------After relocating from South Africa, I accepted this role in the US and was charged with consolidating the US operations, improving delivery mechanisms and subsequently leading the company through the 2009 economic downturn. Despite the difficult market, we have maintained our market position and generated growth through the introduction of new offerings.

Successes included combining the product offering, launching a new business unit that already contributes in excess of 10% of US revenues, a 15% improvement in cost containment, and a major restructuring that has improved services and cross-sales potential.

------------------In this role, I led global operations through a team of COOs in the UK, US, Canada, Germany, South Africa and Australia.

My greatest challenge was to successfully consolidate the various business units, which was successfully accomplished during this period. This included the roll-out of the group strategy to the international operations, thereby establishing a global leader in its market segment. I also oversaw several strategic international acquisitions and the successful completion of a Black Economic Empowerment transaction in South Africa.

After spearheading the entry into the US market, I was asked to relocate and lead that organization from the US.

------------------I moved into this role when my former employer, Corporate Warranty Administrators (Pty) Ltd., was purchased by Innovation Group, and managed the successful integration and transition to the new shareholders.

Successes included playing a key role in revenue growth of 150% as a result of launching new products and growing the corporate client, including international companies such as Toyota, Ford , Sony and Jaguar. During this period, the company grew to be the largest insurance outsourcing business in South Africa.

“Today, through technology, we have more opportunities to connect than ever before. You can allow people to feel what you feel, experience what you experience, and take them on a journey that when done correctly can impact the way they see the world. I started following my passion of filmmaking when I was 6 years old and it’s taken me places I could have never imagined. I’m excited to share my passion, and transform the way the world communicates.”

------------------Leaders understand the importance of personalizing a story, whether it is a face-to-face meeting or how we communicate across the globe. It matters. Unfortunately, today’s world is filled with too many expensive videos, time consuming slide decks, duplicate content and effectively scaling a story worldwide is cost prohibitive. Herculean efforts should not be required.

We believe new technologies should streamline how we work, reduce our costs and improve the impact of our efforts. They should create an advantage for your company. Iternal Technologies unleashes the power of human capital by unlocking your organization's ability to deliver an outstanding personalized customer experience, create access to new customer opportunities, and accelerate growth while reducing costs.

Partnering with various Microsoft teams such as Developer Platform Evangelism, Enterprise Partners Group, and Azure, I participated in developing renewal strategies for key Microsoft global accounts.

The successful development and implementation of my strategies resulted in my consistent overachievement of my annual quota.

------------------Chosen by the Board Chairman to assume this interim position, I was charged with opening ArtinSoft’s operations in the United States as well as managing both a US and HQ (Costa Rica) staff.

To grow our enterprise software transformation solutions revenue, I developed a two pronged approach that included global accounts and systems integrators. By concentrating on the value we added to enterprise accounts such as Microsoft, Citigroup, Thomson Reuters, etc., we were able to solidify and grow those relationships.

They provide mission critical data center server, storage, and networking support for 10% of the Fortune 100 along with hundreds of other brand name accounts.

Mike's vast knowledge of IT support infrastructures led him to also create Bizbang, the first PCaaS (PC as a Service) product offering that provides the latest end user technologies bundled with their world class service organization to deliver best in class support experiences for all of your employees on a simple pay per user per month basis.


------------------Mike’s current day-to-day focus is working closely with the sales team; training, mentoring and growing them while additionally overseeing the entire operations and all financial aspects of the company; from customer and prospect contract price points to vendor relationship and procurement.

Mike encourages innovative ideas and has created a workforce who genuinely cares about each other and the success of the company.

------------------After the devastating Haitian earthquake in 2010, our CEO, Mike Roberts, heard about the devastation while in church and realized that he had the right resources to help. Despite the fact that he had never done any direct mission work before, Mike felt compelled to take action the very next day. Mike and his team rapidly assembled four relief trips to Haiti, which used his private jet to bring much-needed physicians and medical supplies into the country. Service IT Direct employees helped coordinate the entire operation – from working with the Dallas physicians to collecting supplies – in less than 48 hours. Roberts joined the physicians on the trip, helping direct the chaotic triage situation at the hospital and clearing obstacles so that the physicians could save lives. As a result of volunteers driven by human compassion, lives were saved.

The stakes are high in today's competitive business environment. Companies that are able to advance rapidly, adapting to changing market conditions and leveraging new technologies, have a significant competitive advantage.

Companies that fall behind the curve, the risk of becoming irrelevant is real. If they lack the innovative capabilities needed to keep up with their competitors and remain relevant in the marketplace, they may simply fail to thrive in an increasingly crowded and dynamic business landscape.

In the past, collecting and analyzing data was a time-consuming and expensive process. However, thanks to advances in technology, businesses can now collect vast amounts of data more easily and cheaply than ever before.

I have been fortunate to be taught by some of the world’s leading experts in artificial intelligence and lectured at NUST in Pakistan, where I managed several projects including developing an Autonomous Air Vehicle. I have done two post doctorates both at Australian Center for Field Robotics - one where I used my skills to map weeds for better land management for farmers and land managers. My other postdoc was in collaboration with Rio Tinto to reduce the wastage of coal by more efficiently drilling blast holes for coal seam estimation. Both of these opportunities utilized my perception skills (based on Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Field Robotics).

Over the last 18 years, I have worked in a variety of different industries such as molecular biology, marine ecology, mining, land management, agriculture, and deep-water exploration. In fact, one of my proudest moments was being the first Pakistani to set sail on the Nautilus EV (with Bob Ballard, discoverer of the Titanic) exploring the depths of the Caribbean and Pacific oceans. This was a life-changing experience that helped me further understand the Earth's processes and the possibilities for life to thrive in the ocean’s most extreme environment.

Now, as co-founder and CEO of Abyss Solutions, I lead a team of over 100 people on the bleeding edge of autonomous inspection - providing the intelligence businesses need to inspect assets regularly and reliably at scale with world-leading speed and accuracy.

My team and I are utilizing next-generation field robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technology to deliver market-leading inspection solutions for some of the biggest and most well-respected companies across the globe. We are constantly striving to find pioneering solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges in some of the world’s most complex and challenging environments across land, sea, air, and space.

As a father of two beautiful children, I feel driven to protect the world’s most valuable assets and resources and ensure people never have to put themselves in dangerous environments ever again. I am proud of Abyss’ commitment to creating a safer and more sustainable future through the unlimited potential of autonomous robotics - enabling businesses to protect the resources they have whilst finding new ones – on this planet and others.

------------------Weed mapping based on detection ad classification of a variety of invasive weed species across Australia using aerial drone footage from a variety of fixed wing and rotary wing platforms. The detections and classification were used to create data products such as geo-referenced weed maps containing density analysis, weed count by type, size, geometry, etc. These data products were generated for a variety of land management organisations, farmers, etc across Australia to help manage and control the invasion of weeds. Data was typically collected by myself and a team of engineers on the field.

------------------I am the founder of Tekmetric, an auto repair shop management system that has improved the lives of hundreds of shop owners by streamlining their shops and bringing their operations into the 21st century. Tekmetric provides a full suite of workflow enhancements, business intelligence tools, and reporting to a wide range of shop owners, MSOs, and enterprise level executives in the automotive repair industry.

I developed Tekmetric because I was a shop owner myself and encountered the common pain points almost all other shop owners face: convincing folks to skip the dealership, gaining the trust of guests, drumming up word of mouth, and building a base for referrals and repeat customers. I noticed that the automotive repair industry was stuck in the past. The shop management systems available to me and other shop owners consisted of a patch-work of outdated programs and integrations that would periodically crash, making it nearly impossible for any shop owner to provide guests with a quality repair experience. I was already using the latest cloud and web-based technology as a physician and data-security expert. Why couldn’t I use it for my auto repair shop, too? With the fusion of knowledge gained from the various industries I have worked in, Tekmetric was born.

I have spent years developing a cloud-based shop management system that empowered shop owners. The result: Tekmetric, an automotive repair shop solution specifically designed by shop owners, for shop owners.

I am proficient in critical analysis of business requirements to provide 'out-of-the-box' solutions that add value to cloud-based systems. I am a professional who is adaptable and results-oriented in ensuring deadline-driven operations. I am experienced in providing projects a leadership with a focus on increasing system productivity levels. I enjoy building relationships, understanding issues, gathering and documenting requirements, inventing and specifying creative solutions to problems, and leading teams to implement solutions that consistently exceed organizational expectations.

I built my very first business in India and later expanded to the US. In weathering the ups and downs of launching several brands, I discovered my passion for startup, product development, go-to-market, branding, marketing, and sales.

Marketing is a very powerful and underestimated tool critical to growth. It sounds cliché, but I really enjoy helping small businesses learn and apply the success principles I’ve discovered.

I share my experience and knowledge through my personal blog www.arunkumar.me and my social channels ""Thalam""

Over the years, I accumulated broad knowledge and expertise in International IT and IT-enabled service requirements and solutions. I earned a Master’s in Computer Applications and a Master’s in Business Administration (BPO). I applied my knowledge in my businesses and reaped the results! With 350+ employees I successfully launched and grew four lucrative brands:

1. Jugl.com
2. Flobile.com
2. MedicalLegalSpider.com
3. Capdigisoft.com

I see education as vital to business success. I spent approximately six years teaching almost 3,000 students who are now scattered around the world. As a direct result, I was able to publish “Computer Tutor,” my first book on computer literacy.

How do I know my methods work? When I taught my students, I split the class in half. One half presented questions while the others answered. Module by module, we created a database, if you will, of real-world knowledge. Before I knew it, my students were passing our Q&A sessions on to other students. Upon seeing their success, I combined the modules and created a working guide. Since publication over 10,000 copies have been distributed!

My goal is to continue that teaching. In my businesses I show others how to:
• Leverage the power of marketing and sales
• Learn from the successes and mistakes of others
• Generate an ideal client list and help to stay connected
The path of learning never ends.

------------------With Jugl, businesses own and manage all of the communications happening between their people and projects.

By using Jugl, businesses benefit from:

Complete control over your company’s communications and data
Enhanced security with the ability to wipe company data from personal devices

------------------I founded CAP Digisoft Solutions in 2007. We promise to support businesses by first, leveraging technology, and second, using global human resources to optimize all business processes. We consult and help businesses build their ideal client base and stay connected to ensure that the new client base provides referrals.

After applying modern marketing and sales processes to my own company brands, I realized I’m very passionate about technology-enabled marketing and sales.

I authored the online marketing book “21 Ways to Increase Online Ticket Sales”. I compiled all the book’s tips and techniques from personal experience and hard lessons learned in the last few years. Even though written for the ticket industry, the core advice will help anyone selling products or services online. Look for the link to read it for FREE.

Through www.CAPDigisoft.com I launched these brands:

www.DirectSeats.com – DirectSeats.com is my eCommerce business, DirectSeats.com sell sports, concerts and theater tickets. Our website holds all most all leading tickets in the USA. We are ranked within top 50 in this market.

------------------At Faster Capital we help start ups on co-founding and co-funding basis. Faster capital provides incubation services, seed funding and great mentors which are essential for any great idea to flourish.

FasterCapital is a new model startup incubator. Conceptualized in 2010 the founders identified that there are several weaknesses in the current incubators worldwide. These weaknesses were leaving an important segment of entrepreneurs with no source for true help in launching their operation and all the required components towards profitability.

Older financing models were also affecting the success rate of startups as many don't raise 1) enough money and 2) at the right time which proved a major cause for early phase failure.

As a co-founder we work with entrepreneurs on developing the software side of the start-up (mobile, web). As a co-funder, we co fund the start-up and get larger equity in it. With Faster Capital The entrepreneurs are not left alone and the incubator is ready to support the start up and finance it over a period of one to two years until it starts to generate income.

As an incubator we provide idea validation, feasibility study, market analysis, product development, help in sales/marketing, mentor-ship and financial help until the start up is cash-flow positive.We focus on non-technical entrepreneurs who have good experience in a domain and who would like to build their new start up. We help them by being a virtual incubator offering mentor ship, contacts, sales lead and others

Co-Founder: FC will help in putting strategies, studying the market, improve on the idea, assess feasibility study and many more. We will also do all the development work on mobile, web and back end.
Co-Funder: FC will be the first to co-invest in your start up. FC will supply part of the investment ranging from US$ 50 k – US$ 500 k per start up.

Others have had to survive years of unstable or unsafe family situations.
